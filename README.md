## ✨ Features

- 💬 Real-time chat functionality
- 🔥 Firebase backend integration
- 🎨 Modern UI with dark mode support
- 🔐 Authentication & Syncing
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🌠 Image-gen Support

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tfreechat.git
cd tfreechat
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🎊

## 🔧 Backend Setup

To run the full application, you'll need to set up the backend. You have several options:

### Option 1: Firebase Emulator (Recommended for Development)

We provide a Firebase adapter (though it needs some refactoring love ❤️). You can run it locally using the Firebase emulator:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

### Option 2: Self-Host

Deploy the backend to your own Firebase project or compatible service.

### Option 3: Use the Live Site

Visit [https://tfree.chat](https://tfree.chat) and use your own API keys to get started immediately! ⚡
